This repository contains the code to predict future values of a time series using LSTM neural network model. The code was initially built to take real time data of CPU usage from Cisco routers and make real-time predictions. But the general structure of the code can be used for virtually any real-time time series prediction problem :). 

MongoDB is used for storing the collected data.

With the comments embedded in the code, it should be self-explanatory.

Happy coding!  

The results of the code was compared to the performance of ARIMA and Holt-Winters algorithm on the same data and LSTM algorithm is found to be superior for time series prediction.
